# Albizu-Campos-Tribute-Page
A page I created to honor a patriot of Puerto Rico


The files in the zip folder must be unzipped for the webpage to work. I recommend if you want to see the webpage to download the zip folder since it has all the images and the code can work fine. If you want to see a part of the code you can see it fine in Github. Any reccomendations are greatly apreciated.
