# Albizu-Campos-Tribute-Page
A page I created to honor a patriot of Puerto Rico


The files in the zip folder must be unzipped for the webpage to work. I recommend adding a folder that holds each folder and the index.html and everything should be running fine. Any suggestions are highly apreciated.
